An online banking client built on the Mondo API

Work in progress responsive(ish) web client for [Mondo](https://getmondo.co.uk/).

## Installation
To install this on your web server you're going to need to create the following file `includes/api_creds.php` and replace with your Mondo API credentials.
```
<?php
	 $creds_id = 'YOUR CLIENT ID';
	 $creds_secret = 'YOUR API SECRET';
?>
```
You can then login with your Mondo account!
